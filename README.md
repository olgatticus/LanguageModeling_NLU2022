# Language Modeling with RNNs



Instructions for the execution of the code:

- We suppose to work with an existing directory with path "/content/gdrive/MyDrive/NLU_project/", 
  containing a folder "dataset" with the zipped dataset ptbdataset.zip (at "dataset/ptbdataset.zip") and an empty folder "models". 
- The code cells should be executed one after the other, in the same order in which they appear. 
  Otherwise some errors may arise in the execution.
